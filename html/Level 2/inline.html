<body>
    <p id="para">This is my paragraph</p>
    <p>Now when p tag is used, firstly it takes up all horizontal spaces and makes the next tag content to start from the next line. <br>
        That's why it is called <i>Block element</i>.
    </p>
    <a href="#para">Go To Paragraph</a> <a href="#para">Go To Paragraph</a>
    <p>And here you will see that <i>anchor tag</i> used above just takes space as of its content and stays in line with 
    the text, i.e. don't start with a new line. That's why this type of tags are called <i>Inline elements</i>.</p>
